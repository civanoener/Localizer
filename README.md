#  Localizer

Hello!

I made this simple translation tool to help fellow developers reach more people with their apps.
Since I believe, that more supported lanugages mean more users, it would feel wrong to monetize this.

## Installation

To start using this project the following things need to be done:
- Create a DeepL Account
- Activate the free api for your account
- Copy this project to your locale machine
- Insert your API Key [HERE] (https://github.com/progrunt/localizable/blob/main/DeepL/DeepLService.swift#L44)
- Start the project

## Usage

- Add your strings from Localizable.strings in the left text box
- Choose the language of your main Localizable.string
- Choose the target language
- Optionally choose the preferred translation text style (For me default is good ⭐️)
- Click on translate and await the response!
